# Lessons Learned (Running Retro)

Short retro after each step in the plan. Keep it lightweight and actionable.

## Template (use for each step)
- What went well:
- What didn’t go well:
- Improvements (process/tooling):
- Action items (next step):

---

## Step: CI hardening + coverage + local guard (this step)
- What went well:
  - Added local pre-push CI gate (typecheck + Vitest CI mode); caught failures before pushing.
  - Stabilized tests (Prisma mocks, SSR React tweak), achieving green `test:ci` locally and in CI.
  - Enabled Codecov upload and badges for visibility.
- What didn’t go well:
  - CI broke on prepare due to missing `husky` and Prisma build script approval.
  - Vitest coverage plugin version mismatch caused local coverage errors.
  - SSR test was brittle to React’s server-rendered markup (comment boundaries) and classic runtime.
- Improvements (process/tooling):
  - Pin `@vitest/coverage-v8` to match Vitest major; use CI-mode tests in hooks.
  - Pin `husky@9.1.7` for CI; add `pnpm approve-builds` before Prisma generate.
  - Centralize session access (`getCurrentSession`) and mock Prisma in unit tests to avoid runtime `.prisma` issues.
- Action items (next step):
  - Add pre-commit optional lint/typecheck for changed files (fast feedback).
  - Track CI “time-to-green” and failure causes in Codecov/Actions for 1 week.
  - Gradually unskip session fallback tests with a stable mock approach.

## Metrics to watch (rolling)
- % of pushes blocked by pre-push hook (should trend down).
- CI success rate on first run for PRs.
- Mean CI duration and flake rate.

Add a new section above for each subsequent step in the README plan.

## Working agreements (from shared memory)
These are persistent preferences/agreements we keep in memory and follow across steps. We’ll update this list whenever we update our memory.

- GitHub usage
  - Use GitHub CLI for repository actions when needed
  - When commenting on GitHub (issues/PRs), keep the layout nice and readable, properly formatted
  - After finishing a PR review, leave a concise, friendly closing remark and state that the review is complete
  - After opening a PR, continuously monitor status: if checks fail, fix and update; poll roughly every 30 seconds for reviews/updates until done
  - Always process open PRs before starting new tasks
  - For AI-from-0-to-hero tasks, create issues using the “Agent Task” template with labels: `agent:assistant`, `status:ready`, and a priority label (`P1/P2/P3`). Maintain lifecycle labels (`ready`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, `done`) and deliver each task as a PR with evidence (tests/screenshots/steps). Keep tasks small and atomic
  - Use `GITHUB_TOKEN` from the environment for GitHub CLI/automation; ensure scopes include `repo` and `admin:repo_hook` when needed

- Testing/quality
  - Run tests automatically without asking when changes are made
  - Avoid using deprecated APIs or suppressing deprecation warnings; prefer proper, forward-looking fixes

- Local workflow gates
  - Use a Husky pre-push hook to run typecheck and CI-mode unit tests (`pnpm -r typecheck` and `pnpm --filter web test:ci`) before pushing, to reduce CI failures
